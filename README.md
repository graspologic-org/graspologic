# Notice: `graspologic` is the merger project of `GraSPy` and `topologic`
We're actively merging these projects into one, but you may see some references to `graspy` or `topologic` from time to time in documentation and 
issues. If you notice anything in the documentation referencing either graspy or topologic, please raise an issue (if one does not already exist) 
noting the missed titles so we can address all of them.

# Overview
A graph, or network, provides a mathematically intuitive representation of data with some sort of relationship between items. For example, a social network can be represented as a graph by considering all participants in the social network as nodes, with connections representing whether each pair of individuals in the network are friends with one another. Naively, one might apply traditional statistical techniques to a graph, which neglects the spatial arrangement of nodes within the network and is not utilizing all of the information present in the graph. In this package, we provide utilities and algorithms designed for the processing and analysis of graphs with specialized graph statistical algorithms.

# Documentation
The official documentation with usage is at https://graspologic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Please visit the [tutorial section](https://graspologic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) in the official website for more in depth usage.

# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
`graspologic` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations. 

## Software requirements
### OS Requirements
`graspologic` is tested on the following OSes:
- Linux x64
- macOS x64
- Windows 10 x64

And across the following versions of Python:
- 3.6 (x64)
- 3.7 (x64)
- 3.8 (x64)

If you try to use `graspologic` for a different platform than the ones listed and notice any unexpected behavior,
please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/new).  It's better for ourselves and our users 
if we have concrete examples of things not working!

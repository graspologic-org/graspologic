class SignalSubgraph:
    """
    Estimate the signal-subgraph of a set of labeled graph samples.

    The incoherent estimator finds the signal-subgraph, constrained by the number of edges.
    The coherent estimator finds the signal-subgraph, constrained by the number of edges and by the number of vertices that the edges in the signal-subgraph may be incident to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs: array-like, shape (n_vertices, n_vertices, s_samples)
        A series of labeled (n_vertices, n_vertices) unweighted graph samples. If undirected, the upper or lower triangle matrices should be used.
    labels: vector, length (s_samples)
        A vector of class labels. There must be a maximum of two classes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    contmat_: array-like, shape (n_vertices, n_vertices, 2, 2)
        An array that stores the 2-by-2 contingency matrix for each point in the graph samples.
    sigsub_: tuple, shape (2, n_edges)
        A tuple of a row index array and column index array, where n_edges is the size of the signal-subgraph determined by ``constraints``.
    mask_: array-like, shape (n_vertices, n_vertices)
        An array of boolean values. Entries are true for edges that are in the signal subgraph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graphs: array-like, shape (n_vertices, n_vertices, s_samples)
            A series of labeled (n_vertices, n_vertices) unweighted graph samples. If undirected, the upper or lower triangle matrices should be used.
        labels: vector, length (s_samples)
            A vector of class labels. There must be a maximum of two classes.
        constraints: int or vector
            The constraints that will be imposed onto the estimated signal-subgraph.

            If ``constraints`` is an int, ``constraints`` is the number of edges in the signal-subgraph.
            If ``constraints`` is a vector, the first element of ``constraints`` is the number of edges
            in the signal-subgraph, and the second element of ``constraints``
            is the number of vertices that the signal-subgraph must be incident to.

def quadratic_assignment(A, B, method="faq", options=None):
    r"""
    Approximates solution to the quadratic assignment problem and
    the graph matching problem.
    Quadratic assignment solves problems of the following form:
    .. math::
        \min_P & \ {\ \text{trace}(A^T P B P^T)}\\
        \mbox{s.t. } & {P \ \epsilon \ \mathcal{P}}\\
    where :math:`\mathcal{P}` is the set of all permutation matrices,
    and :math:`A` and :math:`B` are square matrices.
    Graph matching tries to *maximize* the same objective function.
    This algorithm can be thought of as finding the alignment of the
    nodes of two graphs that minimizes the number of induced edge
    disagreements, or, in the case of weighted graphs, the sum of squared
    edge weight differences.
    Note that the quadratic assignment problem is NP-hard, is not
    known to be solvable in polynomial time, and is computationally
    intractable. Therefore, the results given are approximations,
    not guaranteed to be exact solutions.
    Parameters
    ----------
    A : 2d-array, square
        The square matrix :math:`A` in the objective function above.
    B : 2d-array, square
        The square matrix :math:`B` in the objective function above.
    method :  str in {'faq', '2opt'} (default: 'faq')
        The algorithm used to solve the problem.
        :ref:`'faq' <optimize.qap-faq>` (default) and
        :ref:`'2opt' <optimize.qap-2opt>` are available.
    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options. All solvers support the following:
        partial_match : 2d-array of integers, optional, (default = None)
            Allows the user to fix part of the matching between the two
            matrices. In the literature, a partial match is also
            known as a "seed" [2]_.
            Each row of `partial_match` specifies the indices of a pair of
            corresponding nodes, that is, node ``partial_match[i, 0]`` of `A`
            is matched to node ``partial_match[i, 1]`` of `B`. Accordingly,
            ``partial_match`` is an array of size ``(m , 2)``, where ``m`` is
            not greater than the number of nodes.
        maximize : bool (default = False)
            Setting `maximize` to ``True`` solves the Graph Matching Problem
            (GMP) rather than the Quadratic Assingnment Problem (QAP).
        rng : {None, int, `~np.random.RandomState`, `~np.random.Generator`}
            This parameter defines the object to use for drawing random
            variates.
            If `rng` is ``None`` the `~np.random.RandomState` singleton is
            used.
            If `rng` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
            seeded with `rng`.
            If `rng` is already a ``RandomState`` or ``Generator``
            instance, then that object is used.
            Default is None.
        For method-specific options, see
        :func:`show_options('quadratic_assignment') <show_options>`.
    Returns
    -------
    res : OptimizeResult
        A :class:`scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` containing the following
        fields.
        col_ind : 1-D array
            An array of column indices corresponding with the best
            permutation of the nodes of `B` found.
        fun : float
            The corresponding value of the objective function.
        nit : int
            The number of iterations performed during optimization.
    Notes
    -----
    The default method :ref:`'faq' <optimize.qap-faq>` uses the Fast
    Approximate QAP algorithm [1]_; it is typically offers the best
    combination of speed and accuracy.
    Method :ref:`'2opt' <optimize.qap-2opt>` can be computationally expensive,
    but may be a useful alternative, or it can be used to refine the solution
    returned by another method.

    The see the relationship between the returned ``col_ind`` and ``fun``,
    use ``col_ind`` to form the best permutation matrix found, then evaluate
    the objective function :math:`f(P) = trace(A^T P B P^T )`.
    >>> n = A.shape[0]
    >>> perm = res['col_ind']
    >>> P = np.eye(n, dtype=int)[perm]
    >>> fun = np.trace(A.T @ P @ B @ P.T)
    >>> print(fun)
    3260
    Alternatively, to avoid constructing the permutation matrix explicitly,
    directly permute the rows and columns of the distance matrix.
    >>> fun = np.trace(A.T @ B[perm][:, perm])
    >>> print(fun)
    3260
    Although not guaranteed in general, ``quadratic_assignment`` happens to
    have found the globally optimal solution.
    >>> from itertools import permutations
    >>> perm_opt, fun_opt = None, np.inf
    >>> for perm in permutations([0, 1, 2, 3]):

    ...         fun_opt, perm_opt = fun, perm
    >>> print(np.array_equal(perm_opt, res['col_ind']))
    True
    Here is an example for which the default method,
    :ref:`'faq' <optimize.qap-faq>`, does not find the global optimum.

    Solve the quadratic assignment problem (approximately).
    This function solves the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and the
    Graph Matching Problem (GMP) using the Fast Approximate QAP Algorithm
    (FAQ) [1]_.
    Quadratic assignment solves problems of the following form:
    .. math::
        \min_P & \ {\ \text{trace}(A^T P B P^T)}\\
        \mbox{s.t. } & {P \ \epsilon \ \mathcal{P}}\\
    where :math:`\mathcal{P}` is the set of all permutation matrices,
    and :math:`A` and :math:`B` are square matrices.
    Graph matching tries to *maximize* the same objective function.
    This algorithm can be thought of as finding the alignment of the
    nodes of two graphs that minimizes the number of induced edge
    disagreements, or, in the case of weighted graphs, the sum of squared
    edge weight differences.
    Note that the quadratic assignment problem is NP-hard, is not
    known to be solvable in polynomial time, and is computationally
    intractable. Therefore, the results given are approximations,
    not guaranteed to be exact solutions.
    Parameters
    ----------
    A : 2d-array, square
        The square matrix :math:`A` in the objective function above.
    B : 2d-array, square
        The square matrix :math:`B` in the objective function above.
    method :  str in {'faq', '2opt'} (default: 'faq')
        The algorithm used to solve the problem. This is the method-specific
        documentation for 'faq'.
        :ref:`'2opt' <optimize.qap-2opt>` is also available.
    Options
    -------
    maximize : bool (default = False)
        Setting `maximize` to ``True`` solves the Graph Matching Problem (GMP)
        rather than the Quadratic Assingnment Problem (QAP). This is
        accomplished through trivial negation of the objective function.
    rng : {None, int, `~np.random.RandomState`, `~np.random.Generator`}
        This parameter defines the object to use for drawing random
        variates.
        If `rng` is ``None`` the `~np.random.RandomState` singleton is
        used.
        If `rng` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `rng`.
        If `rng` is already a ``RandomState`` or ``Generator``
        instance, then that object is used.
        Default is None.
    partial_match : 2d-array of integers, optional, (default = None)
        Allows the user to fix part of the matching between the two
        matrices. In the literature, a partial match is also known as a
        "seed".
        Each row of `partial_match` specifies the indices of a pair of
        corresponding nodes, that is, node ``partial_match[i, 0]`` of `A` is
        matched to node ``partial_match[i, 1]`` of `B`. Accordingly,
        ``partial_match`` is an array of size ``(m , 2)``, where ``m`` is
        not greater than the number of nodes, :math:`n`.
    S : 2d-array, square
        A similarity matrix. Should be same shape as ``A`` and ``B``.   
        Note: the scale of `S` may effect the weight placed on the term 
        :math:`\\text{trace}(S^T P)` relative to :math:`\\text{trace}(A^T PBP^T)` 
        during the optimization process.
    P0 : 2d-array, "barycenter", or "randomized" (default = "barycenter")
        The initial (guess) permutation matrix or search "position"
        `P0`.
        `P0` need not be a proper permutation matrix;
        however, it must be :math:`m' x m'`, where :math:`m' = n - m`,
        and it must be doubly stochastic: each of its rows and columns must
        sum to 1.
        If unspecified or ``"barycenter"``, the non-informative "flat
        doubly stochastic matrix" :math:`J = 1*1^T/m'`, where :math:`1` is
        a :math:`m' \times 1` array of ones, is used. This is the "barycenter"
        of the search space of doubly-stochastic matrices.
        If ``"randomized"``, the algorithm will start from the
        randomized initial search position :math:`P_0 = (J + K)/2`,
        where :math:`J` is the "barycenter" and :math:`K` is a random
        doubly stochastic matrix.
    shuffle_input : bool (default = False)
        To avoid artificially high or low matching due to inherent
        sorting of input matrices, gives users the option
        to shuffle the nodes. Results are then unshuffled so that the
        returned results correspond with the node order of inputs.
        Shuffling may cause the algorithm to be non-deterministic,
        unless a random seed is set or an `rng` option is provided.
    maxiter : int, positive (default = 30)
        Integer specifying the max number of Franke-Wolfe iterations performed.
    tol : float (default = 0.03)
        A threshold for the stopping criterion. Franke-Wolfe
        iteration terminates when the change in search position between
        iterations is sufficiently small, that is, when the relative Frobenius
        norm, :math:`\frac{||P_{i}-P_{i+1}||_F}{\sqrt{len(P_{i})}} \leq tol`,
        where :math:`i` is the iteration number.
    Returns
    -------
    res : OptimizeResult
        A :class:`scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` containing the following
        fields.
        col_ind : 1-D array
            An array of column indices corresponding with the best
            permutation of the nodes of `B` found.
        fun : float
            The corresponding value of the objective function.
        nit : int
            The number of Franke-Wolfe iterations performed.
    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm may be sensitive to the initial permutation matrix (or
    search "position") due to the possibility of several local minima
    within the feasible region. A barycenter initialization is more likely to
    result in a better solution than a single random initialization. However,
    ``quadratic_assignment`` calling several times with different random
    initializations may result in a better optimum at the cost of longer
    total execution time.
    Examples
    --------
    As mentioned above, a barycenter initialization often results in a better
    solution than a single random initialization.
    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> n = 15
    >>> A = np.random.rand(n, n)
    >>> B = np.random.rand(n, n)
    >>> res = quadratic_assignment(A, B)  # FAQ is default method
    >>> print(res.fun)
    46.871483385480545 # may vary
    >>> options = {"P0": "randomized"}  # use randomized initialization
    >>> res = quadratic_assignment(A, B, options=options)
    >>> print(res.fun)
    47.224831071310625 # may vary
    However, consider running from several randomized initializations and
    keeping the best result.
    >>> res = min([quadratic_assignment(A, B, options=options)
    ...            for i in range(30)], key=lambda x: x.fun)
    >>> print(res.fun)
    46.671852533681516 # may vary
    The '2-opt' method can be used to further refine the results.
    >>> options = {"partial_guess": np.array([np.arange(n), res.col_ind]).T}
    >>> res = quadratic_assignment(A, B, method="2opt", options=options)
    >>> print(res.fun)

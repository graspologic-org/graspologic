class AdjacencySpectralEmbed(BaseSpectralEmbed):
    r"""
    Class for computing the adjacency spectral embedding of a graph.

    The adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) is a k-dimensional Euclidean representation
    of the graph based on its adjacency matrix. It relies on an SVD to reduce
    the dimensionality to the specified k, or if k is unspecified, can find a number of
    dimensions automatically (see :class:`~graspologic.embed.selectSVD`).

    Read more in the :ref:`tutorials <embed_tutorials>`

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int or None, default = None
        Desired dimensionality of output data. If "full",
        ``n_components`` must be ``<= min(X.shape)``. Otherwise, ``n_components`` must be
        ``< min(X.shape)``. If None, then optimal dimensions will be chosen by
        :func:`~graspologic.embed.select_dimension` using ``n_elbows`` argument.

    n_elbows : int, optional, default: 2
        If ``n_components`` is None, then compute the optimal embedding dimension using
        :func:`~graspologic.embed.select_dimension`. Otherwise, ignored.

    algorithm : {'randomized' (default), 'full', 'truncated'}, optional
        SVD solver to use:

        - 'randomized'
            Computes randomized svd using
            :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd`
        - 'full'
            Computes full svd using :func:`scipy.linalg.svd`
        - 'truncated'
            Computes truncated svd using :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`

    n_iter : int, optional (default = 5)
        Number of iterations for randomized SVD solver. Not used by 'full' or
        'truncated'. The default is larger than the default in randomized_svd
        to handle sparse matrices that may have large slowly decaying spectrum.

    check_lcc : bool , optional (default = True)
        Whether to check if input graph is connected. May result in non-optimal
        results if the graph is unconnected. If True and input is unconnected,
        a UserWarning is thrown. Not checking for connectedness may result in
        faster computation.

    diag_aug : bool, optional (default = True)
        Whether to replace the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix with a vector
        corresponding to the degree (or sum of edge weights for a weighted network)
        before embedding. Empirically, this produces latent position estimates closer
        to the ground truth.

    concat : bool, optional (default False)
        If graph is directed, whether to concatenate left and right (out and in) latent positions along axis 1.



    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_: int
        Number of features passed to the :func:`~graspologic.embed.AdjacencySpectralEmbed.fit` method.
    latent_left_ : array, shape (n_samples, n_components)
        Estimated left latent positions of the graph.
    latent_right_ : array, shape (n_samples, n_components), or None
        Only computed when the graph is directed, or adjacency matrix is assymetric.
        Estimated right latent positions of the graph. Otherwise, None.
    singular_values_ : array, shape (n_components)
        Singular values associated with the latent position matrices.

    Notes
    -----
    The singular value decomposition:

    .. math:: A = U \Sigma V^T

    is used to find an orthonormal basis for a matrix, which in our case is the
    adjacency matrix of the graph. These basis vectors (in the matrices U or V) are
    ordered according to the amount of variance they explain in the original matrix.
    By selecting a subset of these basis vectors (through our choice of dimensionality
    reduction) we can find a lower dimensional space in which to represent the graph.

        Obtain latent positions from an adjacency matrix or matrix of out-of-sample
        vertices. For more details on transforming out-of-sample vertices, see the
        :ref:`tutorials <embed_tutorials>`. For mathematical background, see [2].

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array_like or tuple, original shape or (n_oos_vertices, n_vertices).

            The original fitted matrix ("graph" in fit) or new out-of-sample data.
            If ``X`` is the original fitted matrix, returns a matrix close to
            ``self.fit_transform(X)``.

            If ``X`` is an out-of-sample matrix, n_oos_vertices is the number
            of new vertices, and n_vertices is the number of vertices in the
            original graph. If tuple, graph is directed and ``X[0]`` contains
            edges from out-of-sample vertices to in-sample vertices.

        Returns
        -------
        array_like or tuple, shape (n_oos_vertices, n_components)
        or (n_vertices, n_components).

            Array of latent positions. Transforms the fitted matrix if it was passed
            in.

            If ``X`` is an array or tuple containing adjacency vectors corresponding to
            new nodes, returns the estimated latent positions for the new out-of-sample
            adjacency vectors.
            If undirected, returns array.
            If directed, returns ``(X_out, X_in)``, where ``X_out`` contains
            latent positions corresponding to nodes with edges from out-of-sample
            vertices to in-sample vertices.

        Notes
        -----
        If the matrix was diagonally augmented (e.g., ``self.diag_aug`` was True), ``fit``
        followed by ``transform`` will produce a slightly different matrix than
        ``fit_transform``.

        To get the original embedding, using ``fit_transform`` is recommended. In the
        directed case, if A is the original in-sample adjacency matrix, the tuple
        (A.T, A) will need to be passed to ``transform`` if you do not wish to use
        ``fit_transform``.

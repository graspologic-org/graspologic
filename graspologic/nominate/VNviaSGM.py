class VNviaSGM(BaseEstimator):
    """
    This class implements Vertex Nomination via Seeded Graph Matching (VNviaSGM) with
    the algorithm described in [1].

    Rather than providing a 1-1 matching for the vertices of two graphs, as in
    :class:`~graspologic.match.GraphMatch`, VNviaSGM ranks the potential matches for a
    vertex of interst (VOI) in one to graph to the vertices in another graph, based on
    probability of matching.


    Parameters
    ----------
    order_voi_subgraph: int, positive (default = 1)
        Order used to create induced subgraph on ``A`` about VOI where the max distance
        between VOI and other nodes is ``order_voi_subgraph``. This induced subgraph
        will be used to determine what seeds are used when the SGM algorithm is called.
        If no seeds are in this subgraph about VOI, then a UserWarning is thrown, and
        ``nomination_list_`` is None.

    order_seeds_subgraph: int, positive (default = 1)
        Order used to  create induced subgraphs on ``A`` and ``B``. These subgraphs
        are centered about the seeds that were determined by the subgraph generated
        by ``order_voi_subgraph``. These two subgraphs will be passed into the SGM
        algorithm.

    n_init: int, positive (default = 100)
        Number of random initializations of the seeded graph matching algorithm (SGM).
        Increasing the number of restarts will make the probabilities returned more
        precise.

    max_nominations: int (default = None)
        Max number of nominations to include in the nomination list. If None is passed,
        then all nominations computed will be returned.

    graph_match_kws : dict (default = {})
        Gives users the option to pass custom arguments to the graph matching
        algorithm. Format should be {'arg_name': arg_value, ...}. See
        :class:`~graspologic.match.GraphMatch`


    Attributes
    ----------
    n_seeds_: int
        Number of seeds passed in `seedsA` that occured in the induced subgraph about
        VOI

    nomination_list_: 2d-array
        An array containing vertex nominations in the form nomination
        list = [[j, p_val],...] where p_val is the probability that the VOI matches
        to node j in graph B (sorted by descending probability)

    Notes
    -----
    VNviaSGM generates an initial induced subgraph about the VOI to determine which
    seeds are close enough to be used. If no seeds are close enough, then a warning
    is thrown and ``nomination_list_`` is set to None.

    All the seeds that are close enough are then used to generate subgraphs in both
    ``A`` and ``B``. These subgraphs are matched using several random initializations
    of the seeded graph matching algorithm (SGM), and a nomination list is returned.
    See :class:`~graspologic.match.GraphMatch` for SGM docs

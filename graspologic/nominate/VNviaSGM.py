class VNviaSGM(BaseEstimator):
    """
    This class implements Vertex Nomination via Seeded Graph Matching
    (VNviaSGM) with the algorithm described in [1].

    VNviaSGM is a nomination algorithm, so instead of completely matching two
    graphs `A` and `B`, it proposes a nomination list of potential matches in
    graph `B` to a vertex of interest (voi) in graph `A`. VNviaSGM matches
    subgraphs about the given seeds and orders many times. All these results
    are then averaged to produce a nomination probability list for the voi.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order_voi_subgraph: int, positive (default = 1)
        distance between voi used to create induced subgraph on `A`

    order_seeds_subgraph: int, positive (default = 1)
        distance from seeds to other verticies to create induced subgraphs on `A`
        and `B`

    init: int, positive (default = 100)
        Number of restarts for soft seeded graph matching algorithm

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_seeds: int
        Number of seeds passed in `seedsA` that occured in the induced subgraph about `voi`

    nomination_list: 2d-array
        An array containing vertex nominations in the form nomination list = [[j, p_val],...]
        where p_val is the probability that the voi matches to node j in graph B (sorted by
        descending probability)

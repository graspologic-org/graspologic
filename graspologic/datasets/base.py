def load_drosophila_left(return_labels=False):
    """
    Load the left Drosophila larva mushroom body connectome

    The mushroom body is a learning and memory center in the fly
    brain which is involved in sensory integration and processing.
    This connectome was observed by electron microscopy and then
    individial neurons were reconstructed; synaptic partnerships
    between these neurons became the edges of the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    return_labels : bool, optional (default=False)
        whether to have a second return value which is an array of
        cell type labels for each node in the adjacency matrix

    Returns
    -------
    graph : np.ndarray
        Adjacency matrix of the connectome
    labels : np.ndarray
        Only returned if ``return_labels`` is true. Array of
        string labels for each cell (vertex)

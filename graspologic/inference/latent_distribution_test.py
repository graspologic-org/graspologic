    """Two-sample hypothesis test for the problem of determining whether two random
    dot product graphs have the same distributions of latent positions.

    This test can operate on two graphs where there is no known matching
    between the vertices of the two graphs, or even when the number of vertices
    is different. Currently, testing is only supported for undirected graphs.

    Read more in the :ref:`tutorials <inference_tutorials>`

    Parameters
    ----------
    A1, A2 : variable (see description of 'input_graph')
        The two graphs, or their embeddings to run a hypothesis test on.
        Expected variable type and shape depends on input_graph attribute

    test : str (default="hsic")
        Backend hypothesis test to use, one of ["cca", "dcorr", "hhg", "rv", "hsic", "mgc"].
        These tests are typically used for independence testing, but here they
        are used for a two-sample hypothesis test on the latent positions of
        two graphs. See :class:`hyppo.ksample.KSample` for more information.

    metric : str or function (default="gaussian")
        Distance or a kernel metric to use, either a callable or a valid string.
        If a callable, then it should behave similarly to either
        :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` or to
        :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels`.
        If a string, then it should be either one of the keys in
        :py:attr:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.PAIRED_DISTANCES` one of the keys in
        :py:attr:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.PAIRWISE_KERNEL_FUNCTIONS`, or "gaussian",
        which will use a gaussian kernel with an adaptively selected bandwidth.
        It is recommended to use kernels (e.g. "gaussian") with kernel-based
        hsic test and distances (e.g. "euclidean") with all other tests.

    n_components : int or None (default=None)
        Number of embedding dimensions. If None, the optimal embedding
        dimensions are found by the Zhu and Godsi algorithm.
        See :func:`~graspologic.embed.selectSVD` for more information.
        This argument is ignored if ``input_graph`` is False.

    n_bootstraps : int (default=200)
        Number of bootstrap iterations for the backend hypothesis test.
        See :class:`hyppo.ksample.KSample` for more information.

    workers : int (default=1)
        Number of workers to use. If more than 1, parallelizes the code.
        Supply -1 to use all cores available to the Process.

    size_correction : bool (default=True)
        Ignored when the two graphs have the same number of vertices. The test
        degrades in validity as the number of vertices of the two graphs
        diverge from each other, unless a correction is performed.

        - True
            Whenever the two graphs have different numbers of vertices,
            estimates the plug-in estimator for the variance and uses it to
            correct the embedding of the larger graph.
        - False
            Does not perform any modifications (not recommended).

    pooled : bool (default=False)
        Ignored whenever the two graphs have the same number of vertices or
        ``size_correction`` is set to False. In order to correct the adjacency
        spectral embedding used in the test, it is needed to estimate the
        variance for each of the latent position estimates in the larger graph,
        which requires to compute different sample moments. These moments can
        be computed either over the larger graph (False), or over both graphs
        (True). Setting it to True should not affect the behavior of the test
        under the null hypothesis, but it is not clear whether it has more
        power or less power under which alternatives. Generally not recomended,
        as it is untested and included for experimental purposes.

    align_type : str, {'sign_flips' (default), 'seedless_procrustes'} or None
        Random dot product graphs have an inherent non-identifiability,
        associated with their latent positions. Thus, two embeddings of
        different graphs may not be orthogonally aligned. Without this accounted
        for, two embeddings of different graphs may appear different, even
        if the distributions of the true latent positions are the same.
        There are several options in terms of how this can be addresssed:

        - 'sign_flips'
            A simple heuristic that flips the signs of one of the embeddings,
            if the medians of the two embeddings in that dimension differ from
            each other. See :class:`graspologic.align.SignFlips` for more
            information on this procedure. In the limit, this is guaranteed to
            lead to a valid test, as long as matrix :math:`X^T X`, where
            :math:`X` is the latent positions does not have repeated non-zero
            eigenvalues. This may, however, result in an invalid test in the
            finite sample case if the some eigenvalues are same or close.
        - 'seedless_procrustes'
            An algorithm that learns an orthogonal alignment matrix. This
            procedure is slower than sign flips, but is guaranteed to yield a
            valid test in the limit, and also makes the test more valid in some
            finite sample cases, in which the eigenvalues are very close to
            each other. See :class:`graspologic.align.SignFlips` for more information
            on the procedure.
        - None
            Do not use any alignment technique. This is strongly not
            recommended, as it may often result in a test that is not valid.

    align_kws : dict
        Keyword arguments for the aligner of choice, either
        :class:`graspologic.align.SignFlips` or
        :class:`graspologic.align.SeedlessProcrustes`, depending on the ``align_type``.
        See respective classes for more information.

    input_graph : bool (default=True)
        Flag whether to expect two full graphs, or the embeddings.

        - True
            This function expects graphs, either as NetworkX graph objects
            or as adjacency matrices, provided as ndarrays of size (n, n) and
            (m, m). They will be embedded using adjacency spectral embeddings.
        - False
            This function expects adjacency spectral embeddings of the graphs,
            they must be ndarrays of size (n, d) and (m, d), where
            d must be same. n_components attribute is ignored in this case.

    Returns
    ----------
    p_value : float
        The overall p value from the test.

    sample_T_statistic : float
        The observed difference between the embedded latent positions of the
        two input graphs.

    misc_stats : dictionary
        A collection of other statistics obtained from the latent position test

        - null_distribution : ndarray, shape (n_bootstraps,)
            The distribution of T statistics generated under the null.

        - n_components : int
            Number of embedding dimensions.

        - Q : array, size (d, d)
            Final orthogonal matrix, used to modify ``X``.

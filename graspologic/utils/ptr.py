def pass_to_ranks(graph, method="simple-nonzero"):
    r"""
    Rescales edge weights of an adjacency matrix based on their relative rank in
    the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: array_like or networkx.Graph
        Adjacency matrix

    method: {'simple-nonzero' (default), 'simple-all', 'zero-boost'} string, optional

        - 'simple-nonzero'
            assigns ranks to all non-zero edges, settling ties using
            the average. Ranks are then scaled by
            :math:`\frac{rank(\text{non-zero edges})}{\text{total non-zero edges} + 1}`
        - 'simple-all'
            assigns ranks to all non-zero edges, settling ties using
            the average. Ranks are then scaled by
            :math:`\frac{rank(\text{non-zero edges})}{n^2 + 1}`
            where n is the number of nodes
        - 'zero-boost'
            preserves the edge weight for all 0s, but ranks the other
            edges as if the ranks of all 0 edges has been assigned. If there are
            10 0-valued edges, the lowest non-zero edge gets weight 11 / (number
            of possible edges). Ties settled by the average of the weight that those
            edges would have received. Number of possible edges is determined
            by the type of graph (loopless or looped, directed or undirected).

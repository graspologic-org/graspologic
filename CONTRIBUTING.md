# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

# Issue Submission (Bug or Feature)

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open an issue if you have found a bug or wish 
to see a feature implemented.

In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to submit a ticket to our 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues).  You are also welcome to post feature requests or pull
requests.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the following rules before submitting:

- Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other 
  [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues?q=) or 
  [pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pulls?q=).

- If you are submitting a bug report, we strongly encourage you to follow the guidelines in 
  [How to create an actionable bug report](#how-to-create-an-actionable-bug-report)

## How to create an actionable bug report

When you submit an issue to [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues), please do your best to
follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot faster for us to respond to your issue.

- The ideal bug report contains a **short reproducible code snippet**, this way
  anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) for more details). 
  If your snippet is longer than around 50 lines, please link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) or a github repo.

- If not feasible to include a reproducible snippet, please be specific about
  what **estimators and/or functions are involved and the shape of the data**.

- If an exception is raised, please **provide the full traceback**.

- Please include your **operating system type and version number**, as well as
  your **Python and graspologic versions**. This information
  can be found by running the following code snippet:

    ```python
    import platform; print(platform.platform())
    import sys; print(f"Python {sys.version}")
    import graspologic; print(f"graspologic {graspologic.__version__}")
    ```

- Please ensure all **code snippets and error messages are formatted in
  appropriate code blocks**.  See 
  [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
  for more details.

# Contributing Code

## Git workflow

The preferred workflow for contributing to Graspologic is to fork the main repository on GitHub, clone, and develop on a
branch. Steps: 

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic) by clicking on the ‘Fork’ button near the top
   right of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on how to
   fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the Graspologic repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YourGithubAccount/graspologic.git
   cd graspologic
   ```

3. Create a feature branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a `feature` branch. Pull requests directly to either `dev` or `main` will be rejected
   until you create a feature branch based on `dev`.

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using `git add` and then `git commit` files:

   ```bash
   git add modified_files
   git commit
   ```

   After making all local changes, you will want to push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

## Pull Request Checklist

We recommended that your contribution complies with the following rules before you submit a pull request: 

- Follow the [coding-guidelines](#guidelines). 
- Give your pull request a helpful title that summarizes what your contribution does. 
- Link your pull request to the issue (see: 
  [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) 
  for an easy way of linking your issue)
- All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample usage presented as doctests when appropriate. 
- At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to references in the literature (with PDF links when 
  possible) and the example. 
- If your feature is complex enough that a doctest is insufficient to fully showcase the utility, consider creating a 
  Jupyter notebook to illustrate use instead
- All functions and classes must have unit tests. These should include, at the very least, type checking and ensuring 
  correct computation/outputs.
- All functions and classes should be rigorously typed with Python 3.5+ 
  [`typehinting`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). Validate your typehinting by running `mypy ./graspologic`
- All code should be automatically formatted by `black`. You can run this formatter by calling:
  ```bash
  pip install black
  black path/to/your_module.py
  ```
- Ensure all tests are passing locally using `pytest`. Install the necessary
  packages by: 

  ```bash
  pip install pytest pytest-cov
  pytest
  ```

# Guidelines

## Coding Guidelines

Uniformly formatted code makes it easier to share code ownership. Graspologic package closely follows the official 
Python guidelines detailed in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) that detail how code should be 
formatted and indented. Please read it and follow it.

## Docstring Guidelines

Properly formatted docstrings are required for documentation generation by Sphinx. The graspologic package closely 
follows the numpydoc guidelines. Please read and follow the 
[numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#overview) guidelines. Refer to the 
[example.py](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html#example) provided by numpydoc.

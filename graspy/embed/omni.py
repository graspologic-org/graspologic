    Omnibus embedding of arbitrary number of input graphs with matched vertex

    Given :math:`A_1, A_2, ..., A_m` a collection of (possibly weighted) adjacency

    Then the :math:`(mn \times mn)` omnibus matrix has the subgraph where

    Parameters
    ----------
    method: object (default selectSVD)
        the method to use for dimensionality reduction.
    args: list, optional (default None)

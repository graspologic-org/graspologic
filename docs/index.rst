Overview of GraSPy_
===================

.. _GraSPy: https://graspy.neurodata.io

GraSPy is a Python package for analysis of graphs, or networks. 

Motivation
----------

A graph, or network, provides a mathematically intuitive representation of data with 
some sort of relationship between items. For example, a social network can be 
represented as a graph by considering all participants in the social network as nodes, 
with connections representing whether each pair of individuals in the network are friends 
with one another. Naively, one might apply traditional statistical techniques to a graph, 
which neglects the spatial arrangement of nodes within the network and is not utilizing 
all of the information present in the graph. In this package, we provide utilities and 
algorithms designed for the processing and analysis of graphs with specialized graph 
statistical algorithms.

Python
------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows concise expressions of network
algorithms.  Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that
GraSPy uses to provide more features such as numerical linear algebra and
plotting.  In order to make the most out of GraSPy you will want to know how
to write basic programs in Python.  Among the many guides to Python, we
recommend the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_.

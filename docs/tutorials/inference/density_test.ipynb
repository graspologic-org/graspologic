    "# Testing Symmetry of Two Networks with the Density Test\n",
    "The \"inference\" module of graspologic contains functions that enable quantitative comparison of two networks to assess whether they are statistically similar. This \"similarity\" can be assessed in a few different ways, depending on the details of the networks to be compared and the preferences of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest test that can be performed is the density test, which is based upon the Erdos-Renyi model. Under this model, it is assumed that the probability of an edge between any two nodes of the network is some constant, p. To compare two networks, then, the question is whether the edge probability for the first network is different from the edge probability for the second network. This test can be performed easily with the inference module, and the procedure is described in greater detail below. "

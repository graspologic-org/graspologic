    "# Padded Graph Matching\n",
    "Consider the scenario where one would like to match graphs $A$ and $B$ with $n_1$ and $n_2$ nodes, respectively, where \n",
    "$n_1 < n_2$. The most straightforward fashion to 'pad' $A$, such that $A$ and $B$ have the same shape, is to add $n_2 - n_1$ isolated nodes to $A$ (represented as empty row/columns in the adjacency matrix). This padding scheme is known as $\\textit{naive padding}$, substituting $A \\oplus 0_{(n_2-n_1)x(n_2-n_1)}$ and $B$ in place of $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this is that one matches $A$ to the best subgraph of $B$. That is, the isolated vertices added to $A$ through padding have an affinity to the low-density subgraphs of $B$, in effect giving the isolates a false signal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we may desire to match $A$ to the best fitting induced subgraph of $B$. This padding scheme is known as $\\textit{adopted padding}$, and is achieved by substituting $\\tilde{A} \\oplus 0_{(n_2-n_1)x(n_2-n_1)}$ and $\\tilde{B}$ in place of $A$ and $B$, respectively, where $\\tilde{A} = 2A - 1_{n_1}1_{n_1}^T$ and $\\tilde{B} = 2B - 1_{n_2}1_{n_2}^T$.\n"

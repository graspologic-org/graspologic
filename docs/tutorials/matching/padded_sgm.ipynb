    "# Padded Graph Matching\n",
    "Consider the scenario where one would like to match graphs $A$ and $B$ with $n_1$ and $n_2$ nodes, respectively, where \n",
    "$n_1 < n_2$. The most straightforward fashion to 'pad' $A$, such that $A$ and $B$ have the same shape, is to add $n_2 - n_1$ isolated nodes to $A$. This padding scheme is known as $\\textit{naive padding}$, substituting $A \\oplus 0_{(n_2-n_1)x(n_2-n_1)}$ and $B$ in place of $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this is that one matches $A$ to the best subgraph of $B$. That is, the isolated vertices added to $A$ through padding have an affinity to the low-density subgraphs of $B$. Since the isolated vertices and non adjacent core vertices both have the same weight, the isolated vertices carry a lot of false signal. Instead, we desire to match $A$ to the best fitting induced subgraph of $B$. This padding scheme is known as $\\textit{adopted padding}$, and is achieved by substituting $\\tilde{A} \\oplus 0_{(n_2-n_1)x(n_2-n_1)}$ and $\\tilde{B}$ in place of $A$ and $B$, respectively, where $\\tilde{A} = 2A - 1_{n_1}1_{n_1}^T$ and $\\tilde{B} = 2B - 1_{n_2}1_{n_2}^T$.\n"

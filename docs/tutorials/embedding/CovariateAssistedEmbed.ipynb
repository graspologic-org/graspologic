    "In many network problems, our network might be more than just the information contained in its adjacency matrix - we might have extra information in the form of a set of covariates for each node. Covariate-Assisted Embedding (CASE) uses both these covariates and our adjacency matrix to create and embed a new representation of our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary reasons that we might want to explore using node covariates in addition to topological structure. First, they might improve our embedding if the latent structure of our covariates lines up with the latent structure of our adjacency matrix. Second, figuring out what the clusters of an embedding actually mean can sometimes be difficult - and covariates can create a natural structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate CASE, we'll use a model in which some of our community information is in the covariates and some is in our adjacency matrix. weâ€™ll generate an SBM with three communities, with the first and second communities indistinguishable, then a set of covariates, with the second and third communities indistinguishable. Using CASE, we can find an embedding that lets us find distinct community structure."

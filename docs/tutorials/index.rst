.. _models_tutorials:

Models
======
This tutorial presents several random graph models: the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model, degree-corrected ER model,
stochastic block model (SBM), degree-corrected SBM, and random dot product graph model. These models provide a basis for studying random graphs. All models are shown fit to the same dataset.

Simulations
===========
The following tutorials demonstrate how to easily sample random graphs from graph models such as the Erdos-Renyi model,
stochastic block model, and random dot product graph (RDPG).

Clustering
==========
The following tutorials explain how to cluster vertex or graph embeddings with two
clustering algorithms, as well as the advantages of these to comparable implementations.

.. _embed_tutorials:

Embedding
=========
Inference on random graphs depends on low-dimensional Euclidean representation of the vertices of graphs, known as *graph embeddings*, typically given by spectral decompositions of adjacency or Laplacian matrices. Below are tutorials for computing graph embeddings of single graph and multiple graphs.

.. _inference_tutorials:

Inference
===========================
Statistical testing on graphs requires specialized methodology in order to account
for the fact that the edges and nodes of a graph are dependent on one another. Below
are tutorials for robust statistical hypothesis testing on multiple graphs.

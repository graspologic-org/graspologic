graspologic 0.1.0
-----------------
This release represents the first release of the ``GraSPy`` and `topologic`_ libraries
merger!

In addition to all of the features that ``GraSPy`` had in :ref:`last-graspy-label`,
this release includes a number of feature enhancements and bug fixes - frankly, too
many to go into.

Please treat this as a brand new first release, informed heavily by the prior
``GraSPy``, and extra special thanks to **all** of our
`contributors <https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_!

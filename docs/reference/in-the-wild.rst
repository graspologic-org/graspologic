- Authors in the NeuroData group at Johns Hopkins University "provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of 
the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and 
empirically justified for analysis of connectome data," using graspologic for most 
analysis and examples.

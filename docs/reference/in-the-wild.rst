* `Statistical connectomics <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-023234>`_: 
  Authors in the NeuroData group at Johns Hopkins University "provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of
  the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and 
  empirically justified for analysis of connectome data," using graspologic for most 
  analysis and examples.

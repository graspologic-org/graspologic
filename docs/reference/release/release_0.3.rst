Highlights
----------
This release is the result of over 5 months of work with over 11 pull requests by 
7 contributors. Highlights include:

- Added seeded graph matching as a capability for graph matching, renamed graph matching class to ``GraphMatch`` 
- Added functions for simulating a pair of correlated RDPG graphs.
- Deprecated Python 3.5
- Added different backend hypothesis tests for the ``LatentDistributionTest`` from Hyppo
- Added a correction to make ``LatentDistributionTest`` valid for differently sized graphs

Improvements
------------
- Updated default value of ``rescale`` in RDPG simulation 
- Updated default value of ``scaled`` in MASE estimation 
- Improved error throwing in ``AutoGMM``
- Clarified the API for ``inference`` submodule

API Changes
-----------
- ``FastApproximateQAP`` was renamed to ``GraphMatch``
- ``fit`` method of ``LatentDistributionTest`` and ``LatentPositionTest`` now returns self instead of a p-value

Deprecations
------------
- Python 3.5

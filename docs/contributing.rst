Submitting a bug report or a feature request
--------------------------------------------

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open
an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to submit a
ticket to the
`Bug Tracker <https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/issues>`_. You are
also welcome to post feature requests or pull requests.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   `issues <https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/issues?q=>`_
   or `pull requests <https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/pulls?q=>`_.

-  If you are submitting a bug report, we strongly encourage you to follow the guidelines in
   :ref:`filing_bugs`.

How to make a good bug report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you submit an issue to `Github
<https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/issues>`__, please do your best to
follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot easier to provide you with good
feedback:

- The ideal bug report contains a **short reproducible code snippet**, this way
  anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily (see `this
  <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_ for more details). If your snippet is
  longer than around 50 lines, please link to a `gist
  <https://gist.github.com>`_ or a github repo.

- If not feasible to include a reproducible snippet, please be specific about
  what **estimators and/or functions are involved and the shape of the data**.

- If an exception is raised, please **provide the full traceback**.

- Please include your **operating system type and version number**, as well as
  your **Python and graspy versions**. This information
  can be found by running the following code snippet::

    import platform; print(platform.platform())
    import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
    import graspy; print("GraSPy", graspy.__version__)

- Please ensure all **code snippets and error messages are formatted in
  appropriate code blocks**.  See `Creating and highlighting code blocks
  <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks>`_
  for more details.

Contributing Code
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to GraSPy is to fork the main
repository on GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps: 

1. Fork the `project repository <https://github.com/neurodata/GraSPy>`__ by clicking
   on the ‘Fork’ button near the top right of the page. This creates a copy
   of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on how to
   fork a repository see `this
   guide <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`__.

2. Clone your fork of the GraSPy repo from your GitHub account to your
   local disk:

   .. code:: bash

      $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/GraSPy.git
      $ cd GraSPy

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   .. code:: bash

      $ git checkout -b my-feature

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It’s good practice to never work on
   the ``master`` branch!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using
   ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   .. code:: bash

      $ git add modified_files
      $ git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub
   account with:

   .. code:: bash

      $ git push -u origin my-feature

Pull Request Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommended that your contribution complies with the following rules
before you submit a pull request: 

-  Follow the `coding-guidelines <#guidelines>`__. 
-  Give your pull request a helpful title that summarises what your contribution does. 
   In some cases ``Fix <ISSUE TITLE>`` is enough. ``Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>`` is not enough.
-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate. 
-  At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to references in 
   the literature (with PDF links when possible) and the example. 
-  All functions and classes must have unit tests. These should include, 
   at the very least, type checking and ensuring correct computation/outputs.
-  Ensure all tests are passing locally using ``pytest``. Install the necessary
   packages by: 

   .. code:: bash

      $ pip install pytest pytest-cov

   then run

   .. code:: bash
      
      $ pytest

   or you can run pytest on a single test file by

   .. code:: bash
   
      $ pytest path/to/test.py

-  Run an autoformatter. We use ``black`` and would like for you to
   format all files using ``black``. You can run the following lines to
   format your files.

   .. code:: bash

      $ pip install black
      $ black path/to/module.py

Guidelines
----------

Coding Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uniformly formatted code makes it easier to share code ownership. GraSPy
package closely follows the official Python guidelines detailed in
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ that detail how
code should be formatted and indented. Please read it and follow it.

Docstring Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Properly formatted docstrings is required for documentation generation
by Sphinx. The pygraphstats package closely follows the numpydoc
guidelines. Please read and follow the
`numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#overview>`__
guidelines. Refer to the
`example.py <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html#example>`__
provided by numpydoc.

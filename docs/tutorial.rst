Simulations
===========
The following tutorials present the several random graph models, such as Erdos-Renyi model, 
stochastic block model, and random dot product graph (RDPG) model.

Embedding
=========
Inference on random graphs depends on low-dimensional Euclidean representation of the vertices of graphs,
known as *graphp embeddings*, typically given by spectral decompositions of adjacency or Laplacian matrices. Below are tutorials for computing graph embeddings of single graph and multiple graphs.

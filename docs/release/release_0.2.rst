Highlights
----------
This release is the result of over 8 months of work with over 25 pull requests by 
10 contributors. Highlights include:

- Added ``AutoGMMCluster`` in ``cluster`` submodule. ``AutoGMMCluster`` is Python equivalent to ``mclust`` in R.
- Added ``subgraph`` submodule, which detects vertices that maximally correlates to given features.
- Added ``match`` submodule. Used for matching vertices from a pair of graphs with unknown vertex correspondence.
- Added functions for simulating a pair of correlated ER and SBM graphs.

Improvements
------------
- Diagonal augmentation is default behavior in AdjacencySpectralEmbed.
- Added functionality in ``to_laplace`` to allow for directed graphs.
- Updated docstrings.
- Updated documentation website.
- Various bug fixes.

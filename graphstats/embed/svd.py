class SelectSVD(TruncatedSVD):
    """
    A class that wraps Scikit-Learn's sklearn.decomposition.SVD method.

    Dimensionality reduction using truncated SVD (aka LSA).
    This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of
    truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). Contrary to PCA, this
    estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value
    decomposition. This means it can work with scipy.sparse matrices
    efficiently.
    In particular, truncated SVD works on term count/tf-idf matrices as
    returned by the vectorizers in sklearn.feature_extraction.text. In that
    context, it is known as latent semantic analysis (LSA).
    This estimator supports two algorithms: a fast randomized SVD solver, and
    a "naive" algorithm that uses ARPACK as an eigensolver on (X * X.T) or
    (X.T * X), whichever is more efficient.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <LSA>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default = 2
        Desired dimensionality of output data.
        Must be strictly less than the number of features.
        The default value is useful for visualisation. For LSA, a value of
        100 is recommended.
    algorithm : string, default = "randomized"
        SVD solver to use. Either "arpack" for the ARPACK wrapper in SciPy
        (scipy.sparse.linalg.svds), or "randomized" for the randomized
        algorithm due to Halko (2009).
    n_iter : int, optional (default 5)
        Number of iterations for randomized SVD solver. Not used by ARPACK.
        The default is larger than the default in `randomized_svd` to handle
        sparse matrices that may have large slowly decaying spectrum.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default = None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for ARPACK. 0 means machine precision. Ignored by randomized
        SVD solver.
    Attributes

    ----------
    components_ : array, shape (n_components, n_features)
    explained_variance_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        The variance of the training samples transformed by a projection to
        each component.
    explained_variance_ratio_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components.
    singular_values_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components.
        The singular values are equal to the 2-norms of the ``n_components``
        variables in the lower-dimensional space.

    Notes
    -----
    SVD suffers from a problem called "sign indeterminacy", which means the
    sign of the ``components_`` and the output from transform depend on the
    algorithm and random state. To work around this, fit instances of this
    class to data once, then keep the instance around to do transformations.
